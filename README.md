# 🖼️ AltText AI – Browser Extension for Accessible Images

AltText AI is an open-source browser extension that helps content creators add **useful alt text** to images with the help of AI.  
It aims to make accessibility **seamless and effortless** across platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Medium, Hashnode, and more.  

## ✨ Why This Project?
Adding alt text is one of the easiest ways to make the web more accessible, yet many people skip it because:
- It feels like an extra chore.
- They don’t know what to write.
- They want to, but don’t have time.

This extension removes the friction by automatically generating alt text using AI, then allowing creators to quickly review and edit before publishing.  

## 🚀 Project Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (MVP):** LinkedIn support – detect uploaded images and auto-generate alt text.  
- **Phase 2:** Add support for Twitter/X, Medium, and WordPress.  
- **Phase 3:** Smarter experience – tone presets, multi-language, context-aware alt text.  
- **Phase 4:** API & plugin integrations – work directly with platforms.
